# CiscoVVB-AppDynamics-Plugin

This iSDK plugin adds custom configuration for Cisco UCCE telemetry reporting to the AppDynamics Java Agent. This spares the end customer from having to manually configure the controller application specifically for UCCE. As we explore instrumentation of this Cisco application with the UCCE Engineering team, we will add features to this plugin to allow more customers to expand instrumentation without having to modify their configuration or environment directly.

### To install 

Place the CiscoUCCEAgentPlugin-<version number>.jar file into the <AppDynamics Java Agent Home>/ver#*/sdk-plugins directory
